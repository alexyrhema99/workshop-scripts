```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE)
```

## Data Used

We will be using two datasets:

- [Library **point** data](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Education/Libraries-Locations-Hours-and-Contact-Information/x8fc-8rcq)
- [Community *area* polygons](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Facilities-Geographic-Boundaries/Boundaries-Community-Areas-current-/cauq-8yn6)

We will store these as the `libraries` and `areas` datasets.

### Details of Data

1. The data was collected from Chicago Open Data.
2. The data was last updated in 2017.

# Load Packages

```{r packages, message=FALSE}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
```

# Read and project data

```{r project-data, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
libraries <- read_sf("https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/psqp-6rmg.geojson")
areas <- read_sf("https://data.cityofchicago.org/resource/igwz-8jzy.geojson")

libraries <- st_transform(libraries, 32616)
areas <- st_transform(areas, 32616)

libraries
areas
```

# Make a map!

```{r map, fig.height=3, fig.width=3}
ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = areas) +
  geom_sf(data = libraries)
```




## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
